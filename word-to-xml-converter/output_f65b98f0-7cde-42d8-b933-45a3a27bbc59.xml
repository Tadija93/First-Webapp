    <text>Title: A Day at the Beach</text>
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    <text>Paragraph 1: The sun was shining brightly as I walked along the sandy beach. The waves were crashing against the shore, and seagulls were soaring overhead. I found a nice spot under a shady tree and spread out my towel.</text>
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    <text>Paragraph 2: I took out my book and started to read, but I couldn't help but be distracted by the beautiful scenery. I watched as</text>
    <text>children built</text>
    <text>sandcastles and played in the waves.</text>

    <text>Paragraph 3: After a while, I decided to take a swim in the ocean. The water was refreshing and cool. I floated on my back and looked up at the blue sky.</text>
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    <text>Paragraph 4: As I swam closer to the shore, I saw a group of dolphins playing in the waves. It was a magical sight. I watched them for a while, mesmerized by their grace and agility.</text>
  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    <text>Paragraph 5: When I got out of the water, I was feeling refreshed and energized. I built a sandcastle of my own and decorated it with seashells.</text>
